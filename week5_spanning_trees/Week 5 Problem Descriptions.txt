WEEK 5 PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS

-------------------------------------------------
1) connecting_points

Given 𝑛 points on a plane, connect them with segments of minimum total length such that there is a
path between any two points.

-------------------------------------------------
2) clustering

Given 𝑛 points on a plane and an integer 𝑘, compute the largest possible value of 𝑑 such that the
given points can be partitioned into 𝑘 non-empty subsets in such a way that the distance between any
two points from different subsets is at least 𝑑.
