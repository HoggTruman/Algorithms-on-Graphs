-------------------------------------------------
1) flight_segments

Given an undirected graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges and two vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣, compute the length
of a shortest path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 (that is, the minimum number of edges in a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣).

-------------------------------------------------
2) bipartite

Given an undirected graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges, check whether it is bipartite.
