WEEK 4 PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS

-------------------------------------------------
1) minimum_flight_cost

Given a directed graph with positive edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges as well as two
vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣, compute the weight of a shortest path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 (that is, the minimum total
weight of a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣).

-------------------------------------------------
2) detecting_anomalies

Given a directed graph with possibly negative edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges, check
whether it contains a cycle of negative weight.

-------------------------------------------------
3) exchanging_money

Given a directed graph with possibly negative edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges as well
as its vertex 𝑠, compute the length of shortest paths from 𝑠 to all other vertices of the graph.
